      <!-- <h3 class="extra-margin" style="text-align: center;">Welcome to the Sketch Segmentation Study!</h3> -->

      <!-- <h4 class="extra-margin">Introduction</h4> -->
      <p><strong>Thank you for participating!</strong> Please read the following instructions carefully.</p>
      <h4>Instructions</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>You will be presented with a series of 6 sketches, each sketch will appear more than once.</li>
        <li>Each sketch contain different object classes.</li>
        <li>The sketches are black and white, where black pixels represent sketch strokes.</li>
        <li>At each step you will be prompted with one sketch and one class (e.g. “tree” or "hat”).</li>
        <li>Your task is to annotate or "segment" all stroke pixels that you think belong to a given object class, by painting on top of the image pixels with a brush.</li>
        <li>You can use the eraser to remove erroneous annotations.</li>
        <li>You will have the option to change the size of the brush/eraser.</li>
        <li>Once you have completed segmenting one object class in a given sketch, you will move onto the next sketch/class.You can not revisit you segmentation results.</li>
        <li>The order of sketches and classes will be randomized</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Data We Collect</h4>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Pixel Maps:</strong> Your annotations will be recorded as maps indicating which class each pixel belongs to.</li>
        <li><strong>Time Maps:</strong> We'll record how much time you spend on segmenting each class.</li>
        <li><strong>User Statistics:</strong> Basic demographic info (age, gender) and your self-assessed drawing skills will be recorded. You don't have to use your real name in the user name box.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>The study will take around 15 minutes to complete. You can withdraw at any time. All data collected is anonymous.</p>
